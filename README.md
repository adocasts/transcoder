![Adocasts Transcoder](https://github.com/adocasts/transcoder/tree/main/src/assets/screenshot.png?raw=true)

MacOS desktop application that transcodes a queue of video files into an HLS streamable playlist consisting of video segments for the desired resolutions.

For the output destination selected, each video's transcoded playlist will be placed inside a folder named after the file. For each playlist, the resolution segments will be placed in a subfolder named for the resolution.

For example, if the video is called `adonisjs-quick-tip.mp4` and the resolutions 2160p and 1080p are selected, the output will look as such:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ [selected destination]/
    â””â”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip/
        â”œâ”€â”€ 1080p/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_1080_001.ts
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_1080_002.ts
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_1080_003.ts
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_1080.m3u8
        â”œâ”€â”€ 2160p/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_2160_001.ts
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_2160_002.ts
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_2160_003.ts
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ adonisjs-quick-tip_2160.m3u8
